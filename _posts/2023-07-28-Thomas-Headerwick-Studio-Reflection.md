#### More reflection on the Thomas Headerwick Studio Exhibition

---

Here is the one artwork that really impressed me:)

I was impressed by his ability to capture both the physical and emotional aspects of the place. The play of light and shadow in the painting was amazing too.

The Bay View campus was designed by architects Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) and Heatherwick Studio, as well as Google’s design and engineering teams, and spans 42 acres adjacent to the NASA’s Ames Research Centre in Silicon Valley. It totals 1.1 million square feet, with 20 acres of open space, two office buildings, an 1,000-person event centre, and 240 short-term employee accommodation units.

The interior of the buildings reemphasize Google’s vision for the future of work, designed in response to its understanding of why Google’s employees come to the office, what they need from their teammates, and what they need from the company.

I think It prompts thoughts about the role of such places in our lives and the sense of peace they can offer. Also, his work captures the fusion of modern architecture, natural surroundings, and the dynamic energy that defines Silicon Valley.
