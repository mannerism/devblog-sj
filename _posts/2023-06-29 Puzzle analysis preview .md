#### Feedback

```Janscript
During the colour map puzzle activity, I found it to be a stimulating and engaging challenge. The puzzle 
required careful observation and strategic thinking to determine the correct colour for each region. Also,
the fact that you can play with your friends and you can adjust the difficulty level caught my attention.
One aspect that I found challenging during the colour puzzle activity was the amount of time it took and 
the numerous attempts I had to make to find the correct color combinations. It would have been helpful if 
there were clearer/more clues that could guide me towards the correct color placement. Overall, even though 
there was a chanllenging aspect, I think this puzzle is highly beneficial to activate and stimulate your 
brain.
