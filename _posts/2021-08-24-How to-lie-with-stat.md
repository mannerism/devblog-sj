While shopping for summer reading on Amazon, I came across a book that caught my eye: 'How to Lie with Statistics.' Intrigued, I made a spontaneous purchase. Although I haven't fully grasped the content of the book, it held my interest enough to keep me engrossed in it throughout the day. I'd like to share a brief introduction to the book.

The basis of statistics is mathematics, but its actual content is both
science and art. This is because various manipulations or distortions
 are possible within a given range. The author of this book,
  “Darrell Huff”, seems to start this book with this idea.

#### Description

- The book is a brief, breezy illustrated volume outlining the misuse of statistics and errors in the interpretation of statistics, and how errors create incorrect conclusions.
In the 1960s and 1970s, it became a standard textbook introduction to the subject of statistics for many college students. It has become one of the best-selling statistics books in history, with over one and a half million copies sold in the English-language edition. It has also been widely translated.
- Themes of the book include "Correlation does not imply causation" and "Using random sampling". It also shows how statistical graphs can be used to distort reality, for example by truncating the bottom of a line or bar chart, so that differences seem larger than they are, or by representing one-dimensional quantities on a pictogram by two- or three-dimensional objects to compare their sizes, so that the reader forgets that the images do not scale the same way the quantities do.
- The original edition contained illustrations by artist Irving Geis. In a UK edition, Geis' illustrations were replaced by cartoons by Mel Calman.
