## Creating the Rules

Setting rules for a puzzle was the first thing to complete. A main goal of setting rules is to help users to better understand our puzzle. by setting rules, users are provided with clear objectives and create a challenge. Also, well-defined rules help provide structure and ensure that the puzzle remains fair and engaging.

### here is our brief explanation of each rules:)

1. **How win?** If the problem board matches the answer board, the user wins (yay!)

2. **How to lose?** If the user runs out of moves, the uer loses (uh-oh!)

3. **How to change difficulty levels?** 1. The user can change the board by NxN. 2. The limited # moves increases. 3. There are going to be some obstructions.

4. **Variations** Limited moves for each round, timer, undo button, or reset button.

- Inaddition, we were thinking to add a hint too, but we thought it was too complicated to develop hint systen at our level, so we decided to exclude it..:(

These were me and my teammates' little outlines of puzzle rules.

> My little thoughts: It was kind of challenging to creat rules because we needed to consider UX ( user experience) and UI (user interface). Rules need to be communited clearly to the users and should not confuse them while they play. Translating complex puzzle mechanics into user-friendly language can be difficult, especially when dealing with intricate or abstract puzzles. The challenge lies in making the rules concise, easy to understand, and accessible to users. Me and my teammates thought that too long or too complicated rules would annoy the user, so we made the rules as concise as possible.
