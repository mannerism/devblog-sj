## My Career Report

---

### - My Representative Strength

#### My representative strength was an **ability to adapt to the environment.** Here is a list of my outstanding qualities

1. adaptability to changing situations and environments.
2. A high level of flexibility in altering plans and strategies to accommodate new circumstances.
3. A high level of understanding and embracing various perspectivee and collaborating effectively with diverse groups of people.
4. Proficient in handling unexpected problems or risk factors.

#### And also here is a list of the **roles** that I can contribute in a group

1. Analytical Thinker: identifies issues and logically analyzes them.
2. Planner/Organizer: Taking charge of arranging tasks, timelines, and resources to keep the group on track towards its objectives.
3. Mediator: Assists in resolving conflicts or disagreements within the team to maintain a cooperative and productive environment.
4. Team Player: collaborates harmoniously with others, supports their ideas, and fosters a positive group dynamic.

> "You prefer logical and analytical communication and value factual information and clear evidence, which helps establish the credibility necessary to make decisions. To better utilize this role, it is important to provide people with logical and specific information while presenting sufficient evidence to support it. Also, approaching their opinions or suggestions with an open mind and fairly considering the solutions or improvements they propose is crucial."

This is the part of the career report. I think it reflects my ability to cooperate with others well. I realize that my willingness to be open-minded when considering others' opinions and suggestions is a key aspect of my cooperative nature. I think this openness allows me to value diverse perspectives and encourages collaboation among team members. I can diagnose the situation of a team or organization and improve issues based on data and evidence. However, if I don't look at the situation "positively" or take a "tolerant" attitude, I could potentially hurt other people's feelings. Analyzing these aspects, I see that my communication style can significantly contribute to successful group dynamics and problem-solving. In team discussions, I aim to leverage my strengths to encourage others to voice their opinions freely.
