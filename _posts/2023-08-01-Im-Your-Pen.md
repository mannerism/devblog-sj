#### Here is a basic information about Good neighbors:)

```javascript
"Good Neighbors" is an international humanitarian and
development organization that aims to improve the lives of
children, families, and communities in need around the world.
Founded in South Korea in 1991, Good Neighbors operates in
various countries, providing support through a wide range of
programs and initiatives.

I have started to volunteer thorugh Good Neighbors in virtual means. My role involves translating letters from children all around the world. These letters come from various countries and cultures, and I help bridge the communication gap by translating them into a language that the recipients can understand.
(The letters go to sponsors and are from children from around the world; They communicate through sharing their talents or life and exchanging their countries' news.)

It's a fulfilling experience to be a part of connecting sponsors and children, fostering meaningful connections, and contributing to the exchange of stories and experiences between different parts of the globe. Through this virtual volunteering, I'm able to play a small but important role in supporting the organization's mission of helping children in need and making a positive impact on their lives.
