My father is in charge of the ESG field at a major IT company in Korea, so for several years now, he has frequently explained to me what ESG policies are, their purpose, and their importance.

Here is the definition of ESG:

ESG refers to Environmental, Social, and Governance factors that are used to evaluate the sustainability and ethical impact of a company or investment. **Environmental factors** consider a company's impact on nature and the environment, including issues like carbon emissions, resource usage, and waste management. **Social factors** involve the company's impact on society, including its treatment of employees, community engagement, and diversity and inclusion practices. **Governance factors** focus on the company's management, leadership, and corporate structure, assessing aspects like transparency, accountability, and shareholder rights.

- The Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) industry is rapidly gaining popularity and has become a key consideration for businesses and investors globally. It's a framework used to evaluate companies based on their environmental and social impact, as well as their governance policies.

- While companies may be considering ESG factors in their strategies, itâ€™s hard for managers and investors to measure their impact to make decisions accordingly. The reason is that a proper analysis requires a lot of data which needs to be carefully interpreted.

- AI can help analyze ESG data and measure the performance of companies by identifying hidden risks, potential opportunities, and overall trends of the environment in which they are operating.

- The below gives an overview of what ESG data is, why it is important for companies, and how Machine Learning (ML) and NLP(Natural Language Processing) can help to create accurate ESG rankings.
