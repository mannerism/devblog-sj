#### Thrid Week of My Family Workshop

During our family workshop, I had the opportunity to present the college lists I had meticulously researched and compiled. I explained in detail why each college seemed to be a suitable match for me and my aspirations to my family.

Over the past few weeks, our family workshop has been an invaluable platform for open discussions and collaborative decision-making. Each Sunday, we've been diving into various aspects of the college application process, from exploring majors to analyzing colleges' offerings. This week's focus was on presenting the colleges that I believe align well with my academic interests and personal preferences.

Presenting my college lists involved sharing the thorough research I had conducted on each institution. I highlighted program strengths, faculty expertise, research opportunities, and campus environments. I discussed how the programs at these colleges resonated with my passion for data science and statistics, and how they appeared to provide the ideal atmosphere for my growth and development.

Through these presentations, I aimed to provide a comprehensive view of the colleges I had selected and why they stood out to me. This transparent sharing of my thoughts and findings allowed for constructive conversations within the family workshop. My family's feedback and insights were instrumental in refining the list and ensuring that each college was a well-considered choice.

Sharing my research and receiving input from my family has given me a sense of confidence that the colleges on my list are not only academically strong but also aligned with my personal goals:)
