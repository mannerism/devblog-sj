##### As we came up with the rules and ideas/outlines for the puzzle, now it's time to make an icon for the puzzle app. The role of an app icon is crucial because it serves as the visual representation of the app and plays multiple essential roles

It is often the first visual element users encounter when searching for puzzles or apps. A well- designed and memorable icon helps users recognize and remember the app.

##### Here are some ideas

I think each idea has its own characteristic and expresses the identity of the puzzle well.

#### We also worked on making a tutorial for the puzzle

Me and my teammates made it as concise as possible with the small pictures because there is not much space to put all the tutorial in a cell phone screen.

The one who made this tutorial also added captions for each pictures, As you can see, the captions are concise and brief.
