#### First week of our family workshop

---

Over the weekend, my family and I participated in a family workshop, where we discussed various topics, including the Common App application and college majors. Interestingly, our discussion led us to explore the field of data science and statistics as a potential major for me.

As we delved into the college application process through the Common App, we found ourselves reflecting on my interests and strengths. The idea of majoring in data science (or statistics!) emerged from our conversation, as we realized that I have always been intrigued by numbers, patterns, and problem-solving. This aligns well with the skills and knowledge required in these fields.

Our family workshop became a platform for us to not only discuss the practical aspects of the college application but also to explore potential academic paths. We weighed the pros and cons of different majors and considered the future job prospects and opportunities they might offer.

I think this is a good opportunity to have open discussions with my family about my educational journey. Their insights and perspectives helped me gain a clearer understanding of my own aspirations and the various paths available to me. While the process of deciding on a major and applying to colleges can be daunting, having my family's support and insights has made it a more informed and collaborative endeavor.
