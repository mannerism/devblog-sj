Me and my mom went to an exhibition of Thomas Heatherwick in Seoul, South Korea. It was a great experience to obtain a unique perspective on abstraction and creativity. The collection of artworks was diverse and each artworks seemed to tell a story or meaning.

#### Here is a little explanation about Thomas Heatherwick Studio Exhibition

```javascript
 Established in 1994 in London, Heatherwick Studio has undertaken innovative 
 projects in many cities including New York, Singapore, Shanghai, and Hong Kong,
evolving to become one of the most closely-watched design teams in the world. 
Founder Thomas Heatherwick (born 1970 in UK) recounts how he would often find 
himself moved during his childhood by the “soulfulness” of small things that were
made by craftspeople and artisans.
Every design is rooted in a belief that even projects as large as a city can have a 
human-scale, while harnessing the energies of the natural world and memories 
contained within architecture into new designs. At the core of this approach is the 
creation of places for gathering, dialogue, recreation, and enjoyment,
 instead of the design of “hard” elements that so often characterize products 
 and buildings. Even as the Studio studies the history of objects and places, 
 researches a wide spectrum of materials, and pays homage to traditional
  craftsmanship, their spaces, which deploy the latest developments in engineering, 
  are replete with innovative ideas that seem to have eluded everyone else

The use of color and light in Headerwick's paintings was particularly captivating. His mastery of these elements breathed life into his subjects, whether it was a bustling city street or a tranquil countryside scene. What stood out to me was Headerwick's attention to detail. His precision in capturing intricate textures, from the weathered facades of buildings to the delicate petals of flowers, added depth and authenticity to his work.

I would like to visit again if I have any chance!
