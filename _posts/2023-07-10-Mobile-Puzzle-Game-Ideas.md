### initial ideas

> After we analyzed ux and ui data such as age, gender, nationality, and their preference, we came up with lots of ideas for Golden Brain puzzle game, and here are some noticeable ideas :)

First idea was a counting triangles in a figure, which is that user needs to count the total number of triangles in the figure presented. I thought this idea would improve users' creativity and mathematical skills. I also thought that it would be good to play puzzles using the faces of celebrities or people that user likes. **However,** It was too complicated to develop this kind of puzzle with our coding skills. Maybe I can try to devlop this kind of puzzle later.

Second one was a puzzle that is similar to a sudoku. A user needs to fill a 9x9 (or bigger) grid with numbers based on hint numbers that are already provided. I thought users might not find this very interesting.

Third one was a puzzle where user is given a shape made up of smaller shapes and needs to find the number of a specific shape in the given shape. I thought it would improve users memorization and creativity. And also if we put icons that users like, that would increase users' interests toward a puzzle.

Last one was a puzzle that a user needs to find cards with the same letter and flip it. We thought the puzzle could be user friendly white providing user friendly words such as names of fruits.

#### Fianl Decision
